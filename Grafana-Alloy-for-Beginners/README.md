# Alloy configuration language 101
🧩 Watch the episode below to learn the basics of Alloy’s configuration language and how to start building your own pipelines!

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fN0uwuwm1Fo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN0uwuwm1Fo)

### Think of Alloy as our trusty pal who can collect, process, and export our telemetry data. 

![Alt Text](https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExM2kweW0xMzU5bzQ3ZHUxZDdnbHFid3I0NGoyd3I2am11eHRoYnRsNyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/xTiTnuhyBF54B852nK/giphy.gif)

To instruct Alloy on how we want that done, we must write these instructions in a language (`Alloy syntax`) that Alloy understands. 

<img width="1876" height="1052" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/451e990c-36a1-47f4-829f-d5c4bb1e7708" />

The `usage` section gives you an example of how this particular component could be configured. 

<img width="1872" height="1051" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2df884bc-ae97-4d65-975b-95e2904013b9" />

The `arguments` and `blocks` sections list what you could do with the data. Pay close attention to the name, type, description, default, and required columns so Alloy could understand what you want it to do! 

<img width="1873" height="1053" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08888cf8-68cb-48d3-a51b-ed4ca89b1430" />

To stop the environment, run the following command from within the project's root directory:
```
make stop
```

Open the project using a text editor of your choice.
- Expand the alloy folder and open the `config.alloy` file.
- We will be using this file to build pipelines for Infrastructure Observability and Applications Observability. 

# Infrastructure Observability
## Collect, process, and export infrastructure logs and metrics
### Section 1: Build a pipeline for infrastructure logs with Alloy
🪵 Watch the episode below to learn how to build a pipeline for infrastructure logs using Grafana Alloy!
[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/FFtvoc6iQVE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFtvoc6iQVE)

#### Objectives
- Collect logs from Alloy using the [`logging`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/config-blocks/logging/) block
- Use [`loki.relabel`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/loki.relabel/) to add labels to the logs
- Use [`loki.write`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/loki.write/) to export logs to Loki

#### Instructions

Open `config.alloy` in your editor and copy the following starter code into it:

```alloy/config.alloy
//Section 1

logging {
  format = "//TODO: Fill this in"
  level  = "//TODO: Fill this in"
  write_to = [//TODO: Fill this in]
}

loki.relabel "alloy_logs" {
   forward_to = [//TODO: Fill this in]

    rule {
        target_label = "//TODO: Fill this in"
        replacement = "//TODO: Fill this in"
    }

    rule {
        target_label = "//TODO: Fill this in"
        replacement = "//TODO: Fill this in" 
    }
}

loki.write "mythical" {
    endpoint {
       url = "//TODO: Fill this in"
    } 
}
```
#### Tasks

`logging` block:
- set the log format to "logfmt"
- set the log level to "debug"
- send the logs to the receiver of the`loki.relabel.alloy_logs` component

`loki.relabel` component:
- Use the `rule` block to
  - set the `group` label to "infrastructure"
  - set the `service` label to "alloy"
  - **Note**: These rules are applied in the order they are written!
- forward the logs to the receiver of the `loki.write.mythical` component

`loki.write` component:
- export the logs to a locally running Loki database ("http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push")

<img width="1874" height="1053" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/649fe505-e3a6-4a74-b998-f00975f9d040" />

<details>
  <summary><h4>Expand to see the solution</h4></summary>

```alloy
//Section 1
logging {
    format = "logfmt"
    level  = "debug"

    write_to = [loki.relabel.alloy_logs.receiver]
}

loki.relabel "alloy_logs" {
    forward_to = [loki.write.mythical.receiver]

    rule {
        target_label = "group"
        replacement  = "infrastructure"
    }

    rule {
        target_label = "service"
        replacement  = "alloy" 
    }
}

loki.write "mythical" {
    endpoint {
        url = "http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push"
    } 
}
```

</details>

#### Reloading the config

Whenever we make changes to the file, we must reload the config. 

To reload Alloy's config, hit the following endpoint in a browser or with a tool like `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:12345/-/reload
```

If the config is valid, we should see a response like the following:

```
config reloaded
```

#### Verification

Navigate to the [Dashboards](http://localhost:3000/dashboards) page and select the `Section 1 Verification` dashboard.

You should see the panels populated with data, showing the number of logs being sent by Alloy as well as the logs themselves.

<img width="911" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07d04e94-caa5-4316-92dc-a50ebfdb333a" />

Expand a log line to view its labels. 

You should see labels "group = infrastructure" and "service = alloy".

### Section 2: Build a pipeline for infrastructure metrics with Alloy - Part I
📊 Watch the episode below to learn how to discover, collect, process, and export infrastructure metrics using Grafana Alloy!

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/tT2r5gHFqzY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT2r5gHFqzY)

#### Objectives
- Use the [`discovery.http`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/discovery/discovery.http/) component to discover the targets to scrape
- Scrape the targets' metrics using the [`prometheus.scrape`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.scrape/) component
- Use the [`prometheus.remote_write`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.remote_write/) component to export metrics to the locally running Mimir

In this section, we will learn how to perform service discovery using Alloy. (`discovery.http`). 

When we’re monitoring infrastructure or applications, we’re often working in dynamic environments where things are constantly changing.
<img width="907" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f420f7c3-87c6-40c6-9be4-d594aa498338" />

There could be 1000 servers or containers starting and stopping whose names and addresses are constantly changing.
<img width="908" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe1aae3a-4552-4c1a-8c34-6d05e18b1be6" />

We want to avoid keeping up with ever changing list of sources that we need to collect telemetry from. 

Instead of hard coding all the names and addresses of all the telemetry sources, what if there was a system that automatically tracked all the telemetry sources in our environment and Alloy could query it to discover what to collect from?

That’s exactly what service discovery components do. They are configured to query systems like the Kubernetes API or AWS EC2, which already track your infrastructure. Then they retrieve and format the list of discovered targets, exposing them to other Alloy components to collect telemetry from.


#### Instructions

Open `config.alloy` in your editor and copy the following code into it:

```alloy
//Section 2
discovery.http "service_discovery" {
    url = "//TODO: Fill this in"
    refresh_interval = "2s"
}

prometheus.scrape "infrastructure" {
    scrape_interval = "2s"
    scrape_timeout  = "2s"

    targets    = //TODO: Fill this in
    forward_to = [//TODO: Fill this in]
}

prometheus.remote_write "mimir" {
   endpoint {
    url = "//TODO: Fill this in"
   }
}
```
#### Tasks

`discovery.http` component:
- Ping an HTTP within our lab environment in charge of finding targets("http://service-discovery/targets.json")
  - this http endpoint is aware of all instances of Loki, Tempo, Mimir, and Pyroscope databases that are currently running within our environment
- Set the `refresh_interval` argument to 2 seconds for demo purposes 

`prometheus.scrape` component:
- Set the scrape interval and scrape timeout to 2 seconds
- Scrape `discovery.http.service_discovery` component's target
- Forward the metrics to `prometheus.remote_write.mimir` component's receiver

`prometheus.remote_write` component:
- Export metrics to a local Mimir database ("http://mimir:9009/api/v1/push")

<img width="1873" height="1052" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43ac7e4e-0389-4624-a502-c57ec079dc6c" />

Don't forget to [reload the config](#reloading-the-config) after finishing.

```alloy
//Section 2
discovery.http "service_discovery" {
    url              = "http://service-discovery/targets.json" 
    refresh_interval = "2s"
}

prometheus.scrape "infrastructure" {
    scrape_interval = "2s"
    scrape_timeout  = "2s"

    targets    = discovery.http.service_discovery.targets
    forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.mimir.receiver]
}

prometheus.remote_write "mimir" {
    endpoint {
        url = "http://mimir:9009/api/v1/push"
    }
}
```

</details>

#### Verification

Navigate to the [Dashboards](http://localhost:3000/dashboards) page and select the `Section 2 Verification` dashboard.

You should see an `up` value of 1 for the Loki, Mimir, Tempo, and Pyroscope services.

If we see a 0, that indicates there has been an error somewhere.

<img width="911" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7f7d7f8-e0d8-4cc2-b76a-c0d03e55d8d5" />

📈 Watch the episode below to learn how to expose, scrape, process, and export metrics from a Postgres database using Grafana Alloy!

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/U_MWuJR76d4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_MWuJR76d4)

#### Objectives

- Expose metrics from the Postgres DB using the [`prometheus.exporter.postgres`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.exporter.postgres/) component
- Scrape metrics from Postgres using the [`prometheus.scrape`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.scrape/) component
- Use the [`prometheus.relabel`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.relabel/) to add and modify labels
- Export metrics to Mimir using the [`prometheus.remote_write`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.remote_write/) component

#### Instructions

Open `config.alloy` in your editor and copy the following code into it:

```alloy
//Section 3
prometheus.exporter.postgres "mythical" {
    data_source_names = ["postgresql://postgres:mythical@mythical-database:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"]
}

prometheus.scrape "postgres" {
    scrape_interval = "2s"
    scrape_timeout  = "2s"

    targets    =  //TODO: Fill this in

    }
    
    rule {
        target_label = "//TODO: Fill this in"
        replacement  = "//TODO: Fill this in"
    }

 //What we have: {instance="postgresql://mythical-database:5432/postgres"}
 //What we want: {instance="mythical-database:5432/postgres"}
    
    rule {
        // Replace a label's value.
        action        = "//TODO: Fill this in"

        // The label we want to replace is 'instance'.
        target_label  = "//TODO: Fill this in"

        // Look in the existing 'instance' label for anything starting with postgresql:// and capture what follows.
        source_labels = ["//TODO: Fill this in"]
        regex         = "^postgresql://(.+)"
        
        // Replace the value with just the captured part, leaving out the prefix.
        replacement   = "$1"
    }
}
```
#### Tasks

`prometheus.exporter.postgres` component:
- Specify the url of a local Postgres database to connect to and expose metrics for a Postgres database ("postgresql://postgres:mythical@mythical-database:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable")

`prometheus.scrape` component:
-  Scrape the `prometheus.exporter.postgres.mythical` component's targets
-  Forward the metrics to the `prometheus.relabel.postgres` component's receiver

`prometheus.relabel` component:
- Add the `group="infrastructure"` and `service="postgres"` labels to the metrics
- Modify the `instance` label to clean it up
  - Before: `postgresql://mythical-database:5432/postgres`
  - After: `mythical-database:5432/postgres`

### How to use the Alloy UI to debug pipelines

🐞 Watch the episode below to learn how to debug pipelines visually with the Alloy UI!

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/B-5bcVlVuMY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-5bcVlVuMY)

Alloy UI is a useful tool that helps you visualize how Alloy is configured and what it is doing so you are able to debug efficiently. 

Navigate to `localhost:12347` to see the list of components (orange box) that alloy is currently configured with.
Click on the blue ‘view’ button on the right side (red arrow).
<img width="1874" height="1055" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96be0cde-1e05-4e4b-b619-98fc44e4c063" />

This page shows us the health of the component, the arguments it's using, and its current exports (green box). 

This page also gives us quick access to the component’s documentation (orange arrow) and a Live Debugging view (yellow arrow). 
<img width="1874" height="1054" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/097eaa44-b346-4c29-badd-44cc90652b9e" />

When we click on the Live Debugging view, we will be able to see a real-time stream of telemetry flowing through a component.
<img width="1872" height="1053" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55491d17-5cf7-48fb-9311-34057e84b3f9" />

Navigate to the ‘Graph’ tab (blue arrow) to access the graph of components and how they are connected.

The number (pink box) shown on the dotted lines shows the rate of transfer between components. The window at the top (orange box) configures the interval over which alloy should calculate the per-second rate, so a window of ‘10’ means that alloy should look over the last 10 seconds to compute the rate.

The color of the dotted line signifies what type of data are being transferred between components. See the color key (purple box) for clarification. 

Navigate to the `Clustering` tab (blue arrow) to view the instances of Alloy. 

<img width="1875" height="1054" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf8e300a-122a-4602-b250-d28bb4b78673" />

A `cluster node` is an instance of Alloy that participates in workload distribution and ensures high availability.

The Clustering page in the Alloy UI shows the status and role of each node, so you can easily monitor which nodes are active, their addresses, and its current state.

**To debug the piplines using the Alloy UI**
- Ensure that no component is reported as unhealthy.
- Ensure that the arguments and exports for misbehaving components appear correct.
- Ensure that the live debugging data meets your expectations.

# Application Observability 
## Collect, transform, and export application metrics, traces, and logs
### Section 4: Build a pipeline for application metrics with Alloy

🔧 Watch the video below to learn how to build your appplication metrics pipeline with Alloy!

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/73Y2LwucXNg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73Y2LwucXNg)

#### Objectives

- Collect application metrics using the [`prometheus.scrape`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.scrape/) component
- Export metrics to locally running Mimir using the [`prometheus.write.queue`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.remote_write/) component

#### Instructions

Open `config.alloy` in your editor and copy the following code into it:

```alloy
//Section 4
prometheus.scrape "mythical" {
    scrape_interval = "2s"
    scrape_timeout  = "2s"

    targets    =  [
        {"__address__"= "//TODO: Fill this in", group = "//TODO: Fill this in", service = "//TODO: Fill this in"},
        {"//TODO: Fill this in"}, 
        ]
    forward_to =  [//TODO: Fill this in]
}

prometheus.write.queue "experimental" {
    endpoint "mimir" {
        url = "//TODO: Fill this in"
    }
}

```

#### Tasks
`prometheus.scrape` component:
- Define scrape targets for mythical services directly by creating a scrape object.
  - Scrape targets are defined as a list of maps, where each map contains a `__address__` key with the address of the target to scrape. 
  - Any non-double-underscore keys are used as labels for the target.
    - For example, the following scrape object will scrape Mimir's metrics endpoint and add `env="demo"` and `service="mimir"` labels to the target:
      
```alloy
targets = [{"__address__" = "mimir:9009",  env = "demo", service = "mimir"}]
```
- create two targets using the following addresses. 
  - "mythical-server:4000"
  - "mythical-requester:4001"
- Add the following labels for each target. 
  - mythical-server:
   - group = "mythical", service = "mythical-server"
  - mythical-requester:
    - group = "mythical", service = "mythical-requester"
- Forward the metrics to the `prometheus.write.queue` component we will define next. 

`prometheus.write.queue` component:
- Set the `url` equal the address of the locally running Mimir ("http://mimir:9009/api/v1/push")

# Hands-on Exercises
### Mission 1: The Hidden Key

#### Description

One of our trusted informants has stashed an encrypted file—`secret_message.txt.enc`—on a remote dead-drop.
This file can be found within the series repo. 

The decryption key? Hidden in plain sight, embedded in an internal label on the service discovery targets.
Since internal labels are stripped before metrics make it to Mimir, this covert tactic kept the key out of enemy hands.

Your mission: use Alloy to uncover the hidden key, decrypt the message, and reveal the intel within.

#### Objectives

- Use the Alloy UI to find the key hidden in the internal label on the service discovery targets
- Decode the key and decrypt the secret message

#### Instructions

Access the [Alloy UI](http://localhost:12347) and look for the hidden key on one of the service discovery targets.

To decrypt and print the AES-256-CBC encrypted secret message, run the following command in the terminal at the root of the project directory, using the key you just found:
`openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -salt -pbkdf2 -in secret_message.txt.enc -k '<key>'`

#### Verification

You should see the secret message in the console!

### Mission 2: The Cardinality Crisis

#### Description

A rogue actor has tampered with IMF's monitoring systems, slipping a high-cardinality instance_id label into a metric that counts database calls.

This unexpected spike in cardinality is putting Mimir under serious pressure -- and it's up to us to defuse the situation before it blows.

You can see the dashboard that informed the IMF that this was happening by navigating to [Dashboards](http://localhost:3000/dashboards) > `Mission 2`.

But it's not all bad news. Hidden within the instance_id is valuable intel: the name of the cloud provider.
IMF wants us to extract that information and promote it to a dedicated cloud_provider label—transforming this mess into a mission success.

IMF has equipped you with the following regex to help you complete this mission:
`^(aws|gcp|azure)-.+`

#### Objectives

- Using `prometheus.relabel`, use the provided regex to replace the `cloud_provider` label with the extracted value from the `instance_id` label.
- Drop the `instance_id` label.

#### Instructions

For this exercise, you may find the following components useful:

- [prometheus.relabel](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/prometheus/prometheus.relabel/)

Go back to the portion of config from **Section 4**, where we started scraping metrics from the mythical services. Paste the following above the `prometheus.write.queue` component (**note**: the order of components does not matter, this is just for organization and readability):

```alloy
prometheus.relabel "mission_2" {
    forward_to = [prometheus.write.queue.experimental.receiver]

  //define a relabel rule to extract the cloud provider from the instance_id label and add it as a new label called cloud_provider
    rule {
        action        = "// TODO: Fill this in"
        target_label  = "// TODO: Fill this in"
        source_labels = ["// TODO: Fill this in"]
        regex         = "^(aws|gcp|azure)-.+"
        replacement   = "$1"
    }

    // drop the instance_id label from metrics
    rule {
        action  = "// TODO: Fill this in"
        regex   = "// TODO: Fill this in"
    }
}
```

#### Verification

Navigate to the [Explore](http://localhost:3000/explore) page and look at the metrics.
Query for `count by (cloud_provider) (rate(mythical_db_request_count_total [$__rate_interval]))` and you should see a non-zero value.

### Mission 3: Attribute Alignment

After much debate, the various departments within IMF have reached a rare consensus: it's time to standardize the attribute name for service tiers.

Until now, teams have been using conflicting keys like `servicetier` and `tier`, creating chaos in spanmetrics and cross-department dashboards.

Headquarters has spoken: `service.tier` is the new standard.

Your mission: use Alloy to bring order to the data.
Standardize the attribute across the board so that spanmetrics flow smoothly and dashboards speak a common language.

#### Objectives

- Use the [`otelcol.processor.attributes`](https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/flow/reference/components/otelcol.processor.attributes/) component to set the `service.tier` attribute to the value of the `servicetier` or `tier` attributes.
- Drop the `servicetier` and `tier` attributes.

#### Instructions

The [`otelcol.processor.attributes`](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/otelcol/otelcol.processor.attributes/) component allows you to add, set, or drop attributes.

Go back to the portion of config from **Section 5**, where we received traces from the mythical services. Paste the following  above the `otelcol.processor.batch.default` component (**note**: the order of components does not matter, this is just for organization and readability):

```alloy
otelcol.processor.attributes "mission_3" {
    // These two actions are used to add the service.tier attribute to spans from
    // either the servicetier or tier attributes.

#### Verification

Navigate to [Dashboards](http://localhost:3000/dashboards) > `Mission 3` and you should see a dashboard with data including the new `service_tier` label, which came from spanmetrics generation using the `service.tier` attribute we just consolidated.

### Mission 4: Redact and Protect

#### Description

The IMF needs your expertise for one final mission.

An opposing state actor exploited a Zero-Day vulnerability in one of our servers, causing sensitive tokens to be logged by the mythical-requester.

The security team is standing by, but before they can act, we need to make sure no tokens are being written to Loki.

Your task: use Alloy to identify and redact any sensitive tokens from the mythical-service logs—effectively, clean up the trail and keep things secure.

Navigate to [Dashboards](http://localhost:3000/dashboards) > `Mission 4`. You will see logs coming in with sensitive token information. 

#### Objectives

- Redact any tokens found in the logs from the mythical services

#### Instructions

Take a look at the [`loki` components](https://grafana.com/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki/). Are there any that seem like they could be useful for this mission?

Which section would you add this component to and how would you have to change the previous configuration? 

#### Verification

Navigate to [Dashboards](http://localhost:3000/dashboards) > `Mission 4` and you should see a dashboard with a
panel showing the rate of logs with tokens coming from the mythical services as well as the logs themselves with the secret token redacted.
